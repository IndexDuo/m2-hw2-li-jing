    <h1>Jing Li</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Jing. I'm currently a Master's student at the University of Florida studying Mass Communication.</p>
    <h2>My hobbies</h2>
    <p>I currently live in Orlando, Florida, also known as the theme park capital of the world. I live very close to both Universal and Disney World. </br>When it's not extremely hot or humid outside, I visit the theme parks alone and spend my day there if I have the time.</p>
    <p>If you are ever planning to visting Universal Orlando, here's my list where I ranked the top 5 rides across both parks:</p>

            <details>
                <summary>Jurassic World VelociCoaster</summary>
                <p>VelociCoaster is the best and the smoothest coaster I've ever been on. This is a thrill coaster that can give adrenaline rush from the queue line. </br>This is a must ride if you are visiting Universal Orlando. It has a single rider line, but it's closed most of the time. This ride is located in the Island of Adventure park. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/things-to-do/rides-attractions/jurassic-world-velocicoaster">More info</a></p>

                <summary>Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure</summary>
                <p><strong>AMAZING</strong> thrill coaster even if you're not a Harry Potter fan. It's less intense than VelociCoaster, but the theming is the just out of the world. </br>It has a single rider line (very slow & do not recommend using it). This ride is located in the Island of Adventure park. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/things-to-do/rides-attractions/hagrids-magical-creatures-motorbike-adventure">More info</a></p>

                <summary>Revenge of the Mummy</summary>
                <p>This is an indoor dark ride. Both the queue and the ride are very well themed. It has a single rider line (recommend using it). </br>This ride is located in the Universal Studios park. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/things-to-do/rides-attractions/revenge-of-the-mummy">More info</a></p>

                <summary >Jurrasic Park River Adventure</summary>
                <p>This is a partially dark ride and a water ride. You wouldn't get soaked, but there will be water splashing you face. This ride is located in the Island of Adventure park. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/things-to-do/rides-attractions/jurassic-park-river-adventure">More info</a></p>

            <details>
                <summary>E.T. Adventure</summary>
                <p>This is a classic dark ride. It may look a little outdated, but it's a must ride. This ride is located in the Universal Studios park. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/things-to-do/rides-attractions/et-adventure">More info</a></p>

        <h2>My interests</h2>
    <p>I'm really into K-pop and discovering new K-pop groups. I also watch a lot of Korean variety shows. My favorite show is New Journey to the West. </br>Other than that, I also like to attend Hackathons so I could chug Celsius (my favorite engery drink) while coding for 36 hours straight.</p>
